# R-midway

R setup on compute cluster to systematically handle multiple versions
of R, multiple interfaces (R, RStudio, etc.), hundreds of users, and
hundreds of packages.

## Aims

1. Improve R module setup on midway1 and midway2 so that any version
of R—including some very old versions!—can be quickly installed with
minimal headaches, and with little understanding of the midway module
system. Also, write clear installation and setup instructions so that
RCC staff can reproduce setup without much help.

2. Make R accessible and headache-free to all RCC users, *including
users that have relatively limited programming experience.* Create a
small webpage on using R.

3. Setup R so that it seamlessly handles multiple versions of R,
multiple interfaces (R text-based environment, RStudio, RStudio
Server, Jupyter, Rscript) and different package installation
locations.

4. Come up with reasonable guidelines for updating packages, and
handling module (library) dependencies.

5. Come up with flexible system for installing packages, and updating
and documenting installed packages. (Special consideration:
Bioconductor.)

6. Provide easily accessible help on most common topics specific to
using R on *midway*. Examples include installing and using packages,
how to generate graphics (ThinLinc, X Windows forwarding), and special
instructions on using RStudio and RStudio Server.

7. Share some of our improvements as a public resource to the R
community (perhaps, ultimately, as an R package on CRAN).

8. Use git and github as much as possible to keep track of progress.
