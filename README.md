# R-midway

R setup on compute cluster to systematically handle multiple versions
of R, multiple interfaces (R, RStudio, etc.), hundreds of users, and
hundreds of packages.

## Aims

1. Improve R module setup on midway1 and midway2 so that any version
of R can be quickly installed with minimal headaches, and with little
understanding of the midway module system. Also, write clear
installation and setup instructions.

2. Make R accessible and headache-free to all RCC users, including
those that have little programming background.

3. Setup R so that it seamlessly handles multiple versions of R,
multiple interfaces (R text-based environment, RStudio, RStudio
Server) and different package installation locations.

4. Come up with reasonable guidelines for updating packages, and
handling module (library) dependencies.

5. Provide easily accessible help on most common topics specific to
using R on *midway*.

6. Share some of our improvements as a public resource to the R
community (perhaps, ultimately, as an R package on CRAN).
