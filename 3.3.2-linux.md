*Add instructions here for installing R 3.3.2 on Scientific Linux 6.*

# Installing R 3.3.2 on Midway 2

To begin, I am following the instructions that I found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#Installing-R-under-Unix_002dalikes), for Unix-alikes.

# Getting source

Files contained in /svnwork/pubsw/software2/R/ (/svnwork/pubsw/software/R contains the same):
* buildopts.sh
- moduleconf.sh
- README
- source.sh
- build.sh.post
- modules.R
- Rprofile.site
- test.bats



The purpose of the source.sh file should be to retrieve R 3.3.2 source and untar it.
Presently, this file reads:

> svnsource https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-$(echo $SOFTVERS|tr . -)-branch
>
> cd $SRCDIR
> ./tools/rsync-recommended

I'll get source using these mirrors:
* https://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/CRAN/	Indiana University
* http://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/CRAN/	Indiana University

The link for the source code for 3.3.2 is http://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/CRAN/src/base/R-3/R-3.3.2.tar.gz
